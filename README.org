** Grading
*** Final Exam
    The final exam will be "take-home", and be made available by 11am on
    Tuesday, May 9 (if there is a *consensus* that an earlier date is
    preferable then we can reschedule).  You will have 24 hours to
    complete the final.

*** Groups
    You should regard yourself as a member of a *group*, and your
    group will be responsible for working together on certain
    assignments.  Group sizes should be between 3--6 (inclusive).

*** Assignments
We will ask you to complete an assignment every 2--3 weeks.  We expect you to work on these with others in your group.  Your *group* should turn in /one/ set of notes and proposed solutions.  The problem sets will feature two different kinds of problems.
**** Exercises
These are called /exercises/ because they are meant more as tests of comprehension
than as more difficult /problems/.  Exercises will be graded on a "check", "check +", "check -" system.

Not completing an exercise will be much worse for the grades of people in your group than receiving a "check -".

**** Problems
/Problems/ are meant less as checks on comprehension and more the part of the assignment that involves more critical thinking.  "Problems" may not have a "right" answer (though there will always be many wrong answers).

** Readings
  - "Hansen" refers to Bruce Hansen's [[https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/econometrics/Econometrics.pdf][Econometrics Textbook]].  This was recently published by Princeton University Press, and belongs on your bookshelf.
  - Other readings will be added topic by topic (usually these will be available electronically).

* Other Resources
** Friday Sections
   Lucy Hackett will hold weekly sections on Fridays.  She'll present
   material pertaining to both econometrics and programming.

   It's critical to note that we expect you to develop some fluency in
   the programming language =python=.
